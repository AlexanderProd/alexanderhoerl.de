## About me

> I love working with small to medium sized companies in the technical sector, together creating beautiful and engaging experiences for their audiences or custom tools based on their needs.

Through deep cooperations with clients in the defense industry I have gained a lot of experience in the field of thermal imaging and the development of custom software for the analysis of thermal images.

Currently working as Software Developer for Industrial Internet of Things applications at Weber Food Technology.
